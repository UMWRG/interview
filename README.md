# Overview
This task is designed to assess the user's grasp of common web technologies
and workflows.

The task presents the user (the interviewee) with an unstyled html page containing some
data loaded from a CSV file and a 'save' button, which sends this data to the server for saving to a new file.

The user is tasked with taking this simple web page and editing
it to present the data more effectively, then to allow editing and saving of this data.

The web page has access to jquery, bootstrap, d3 and datatables. 
The user may choose to focus more heavily on data presentation or on editing.

Most of the tasks may be completed in html or javascript. No Python needs to be changed, but
the user should feel free to do so if they deem necessary.

# Tasks
* After task 1, these tasks can be done in any order.
1. Re-format the data so that it appears in a tabular format. 
2. Update the 'save' button to read the values from the table.
3. Allow each value in the table (including headings) to be editable.
4. Improve the alerting of the success or failure of saving.
5. Improve styling (for example, by using Bootstrap's table and button formatting).
6. Improve user experience by performing error-checking and any other improvements the user deems necessary.
7. Comment on any structural and code-based issues you see. How would this integrate into a larger system?
